npm can be used to create app
but it will download the package
so use npx instead which will temporarily provide the package while you need it
command->     npx create-react-app my-app    --->   it will create my-app folder having all..modules..,etc.

to run --->  npm start

in react stric mode will always be on -->  StrictMode  -->  "use strict"

JSX :
(App.js is our site)
the code is return() --> is JSX
JSX has html and js can be added to this html using {}
JS's reserved keyword will be used with different name in html --> ex. --> class will be used as className
only one element will be returned  --> for that we can use JSX fragment  --->   <></>

Babel

single page and multi page responding

nodemodule folder can be regained by command -->  npm install

git command can be used to add code to github

PROPS :

we are using function based component so there is no need to import react

either add type:"module" in json package or add extention .mjs to module  -->  for module1 and module2 example  --> timestamp 6:28

State :
{useState} is hook
state cannot be updated the way we update normal variable
without reloading page -> function fires
Event Listening

1. State=condition of any component for eg. textarea component might be empty sometime , sometimes it has letters .
2. Hooks= A method which helps us to use features of classes in function based component this is because developer like us prefer to use function over classes.
3. Hooks has this part ---->   const [count,setCount]=useState("Hello Universe"); 
     Here in above hook the value of count is Hello Universe . count is array variable so that we just can't update or change its value like normal variable. 
But we can update or change its value using setCount() method. i.e. setCount("Hey You"); this implies the value of count is updated to Hey You.
Note : Advantages of hooks and this stuff ,  whenever you click Uppercase button page does not reload. Which enhances its capability. 

Alert

onclick needs function not function call

how to dinamically change title

google web masters
favicon generator
react router setup  --->  npm install react-router-dom
page will not reload by using Link-to instead of a-href

deployment of create react app --> github pages  (search on google)

npm run build  --> creats buld folder --> after that only this will be needed to run our website (TextUtils)

you can directly deploy your website on github or can use githubpages
but router doesn't work with githubpages
now write code in the package.json file -->  at the top  -->   "homepage": "https://riturajpurohit95.github.io/TextUtils",
then run --->  npm install --save gh-pages   
then add these two lines in script of package.json -->   "predeploy": "npm run build",
                                         "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
then run---->   npm run deploy
